#### About

* This application is a Simple E-commerce Shop allowing you to purchase items from store that you initially setup. Design is extendable with nice application hierarchy. There are 3 `Micro Services` doing independent calculation, this way it is easy to read the flow of data, and debug it...
* Good Tests and Coverage is also included
* Application runs on **Express.js Server** 
* Good catch exceptions and error handling
  

#### The Store
* You can create own offers against purchases, and quantities of orders, examples available in: `./libs/simple-order/config.js`


#### Why

* You can make e-commerce shop out of this application, the base structure is already in place.

  
#### Stack

* OOP, Express.js, REST/API, build Micro Services _( `Basket.js`, `Store.js`, `SimpleOrder.js` )_, Error codes, Error handling, debug mode, Heroku ready, eslint
	* TESTS: Mocha, Chai, Istanbul/nyc _( code coverage )_

#### Code Hierarchy

We have `Express server` and `SimpleOrder`, application is initiated from `/server/controllers.`

* About `Simple Order - Micro Services`:

-  **/simple-order/Store.js:** : our base class that takes care of `storeData.json` and global discounts

-  **/simple-order/SimpleOrder.js**: extends from Store.js, and initializes the application including the Basket.js

-  **/simple-order/Basket.js** : Every new`order` is a `new Basket()` that calculates conditions and `offers` available from `config.js`. Configuration of this class is controlled via `SimpleOrder.js`

-  **/simple-order/config.js**: default configuration imported to Store.js, but can import yours, __how to__ available in `./examples.js`

-  **/simple-order/storeData.json** : available store imported to Store.js class, can add any more items following the same schema.

**/simple-order/storeData.js** : can also provide as js file

* About `server`:

- it starts via `./serverApp.js`, `SimpleOrder` application is initialized from `./server/controllers.js` with currently one request `get/order(..)` available.


#### TODO

*  **(add)** basketOffers to storeData.json on individual items
*  **(add)** local storage
*  **(add)** Mongo server
